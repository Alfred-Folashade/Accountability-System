# Accountability-System
Accountability System based on the popular anime Solo Leveling
This system functions like any rpg game where you start off at the lowest level then perform tasks and quests to gain experience and level up.
The player starts off at Rank E level 1 and works his way up to Rank S level 100 by doing the daily quests and additional quests of their choosing.
I will be doing this project in java using OOP concepts such as polymorphism, abstraction and inheritance.
